Ubiety the weather app repository.

The app makes use of openweathermaps.org's api to fetch data.

Entirely built in flutter, the app fetches and displays weather data.

I've tried my best to round off all possible errors and fail points.

It has a little feature where it starts a countdown for sun rise/sunset depending on whatever is closer.

It also displays what the expected sunrise/sunset time is (in the location's local time).
